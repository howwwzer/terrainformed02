        Space… the final frontier… may be closer to home than any of us ever expected. With the rapid advancement of rocket technology in the past fifty years, the expanse beyond Earth's upper atmosphere is more accessible than ever before.
    </p>   
     <p>
        The space race has taken on a new life, and instead of the US competing with other countries for a piece of the action, it's now competing with… itself?   (quickly explain spaceports)
     </p>

    <p>
        Becoming a “space harbor” for these ships promises a foothold into this rapidly developing economy, causing several states &#8212 namely, Georgia, Maine, and Michigan &#8212 to pour money and resources into creating spaceports of their own. The Michigan Aerospace Manufactureres Association (MAMA) has been the primary lobbying force in making this a reality in the Mitten State. Alongside the Marquette County Commission (MCC) and bond trader Tom Baldwin, MAMA has set their sights on making Granot Loma and a number of other places in the remote Upper Peninsula the first spaceports in the Midwest. This could be potentially exciting news &#8212 if anybody actually knew about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        A significant recurring theme in this new space race is a lack of transparency. The lack of awareness surrounding the proposed Granot Loma spaceport is exacerbated by the fact that its location is in the Upper Peninsula &#8212 a place that is only thought of as a summer vacation spot for many Michiganders. TerraInformed seeks to confront the citizens of the Lower Peninsula with an issue that is “out of sight, out of mind,” despite it happening virtually in their own backyards. TerraInformed is designed to prompt people to think deeply about the future of humanity's relationship with space and the environment, and what their role in it will be, because deserve to have a say in such a pivotal moment in human history, not just lobbyists and moguls.
