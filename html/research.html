            IN CONTEXT
        </h3>
        <p>
            When you ask someone about space travel, they might mention the space race, the moon landing, or NASA's satellite imagery. For half a century, our conception of space travel has been largely tied to public sector endeavors. However, as technology advances and the private sector begins to invest more in spaceworthy vehicles, space travel becomes less and less of a government venture. The advent of private space travel is far behind us, and we now have to consider the creation of new economies and industries which have come with it. Faculty at the Harvard Business School have dubbed it <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/the-commercial-space-age-is-here" target="_blank">The Commercial Space Age."</a> Below is a summary of Matthew Weinzierl and Mehak Sarang's descriptions of what the dimensions of the commercial space age are.
