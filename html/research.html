            IN CONTEXT
        </h3>
        <p>
            When you ask someone about space travel, they might mention the space race, the moon landing, or NASA's satellite imagery. For half a century, our conception of space travel has been largely tied to public sector endeavors. However, as technology advances and the private sector begins to invest more in spaceworthy vehicles, space travel becomes less and less of a government venture. The advent of private space travel is far behind us, and we now have to consider the creation of new economies and industries which have come with it. Faculty at the Harvard Business School have dubbed it <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/the-commercial-space-age-is-here" target="_blank">The Commercial Space Age."</a> Below is a summary of Matthew Weinzierl and Mehak Sarang's descriptions of what the dimensions of the commercial space age are. Please note that these terms were created by the original authors, and that I am using them to frame the context in which the greater issue that TerranInformed aims to address.

        <h3>
            SPACE-FOR-SPACE ECONOMY 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The space-for-space economy is more immediately available to the public conscience. Space-for-space describes "goods and services produced in space for use in space" <a href="#ref">(Weinzierl and Sarang, 2021).</a> This includes harvesting resources from space, booking flights like an airline, and even colonizing Mars. It's the sci-fi fantasy that billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have been chasing for years. However, space-for-space, by numbers, is not the most active part of this new(ish) industry, despite media coverage.
        </p>
        <h3>
           SPACE-FOR-EARTH ECONOMY 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The less glamorous but no less important item of discussion is space-for-earth. The space-for-earth economy is described as "goods and services produced in space for use on earth." This includes largely involves satellites that are used for observation, internet infrastructure, communication, and security <a href="#ref">(Weinzierl and Sarang, 2021).</a> Think StarLink. It is this economy that is producing the most launch traffic, with up to 200 satellites launched per month <a href="#ref">(Satnews, 2023).</a>

            WHAT ARE LEOS?
        </h3>
        <p>
            "LEO" stands for Low-Earth Orbit, and is used in reference to satellite launches that produce these orbits. Low-Earth Orbits are within 1000km of the Earth, and do not follow a specific route <a href="#ref">(Irwin-Hunt, 2021).</a> Because LEOs can be launched from a broader range of latitudes than their larger counterpart, GEOs, they have become an interest of the commercial space industry. Furthermore, as more investment is put into LEOs, the cost to launch these satellites has reduced over time <a href="#ref">(Irwin-Hunt, 2021, Cost).</a> For a more in-depth explanation of these details, see Alex Irwin-Hunt's article on <a href="https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/feature/spaceports-will-they-lift-communities-on-earth-79925" target="_blank">spaceports and LEO launches.</a>

        <h3>
            BACKGROUND
        </h3>
        <p>
            Spaceports have existed as long as humans have been launching objects into space. Simply put, a spaceport "is defined as a ground-based launch facility that has been used for at least one successful orbital launch," including land or sea platforms <a href="#ref">(Roberts, 2023, Key Definitions).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/spaceports_by_state" target="_blank">FAA list</a> of approved spaceports in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is an <a href="https://aerospace.csis.org/data/spaceports-of-the-world/" target="_blank">interactive data repository</a> of the world's active spaceports, provided by Aerospace. Note Aerospace's definition of active.

        <h3>
            IN CONTEXT
        </h3>
        <p>
            Becoming knowledgable about the commercial space industry and spaceports is relevant as more and more states enter the new "space race" to become the home of the next spaceport. This includes the state of Michigan, where there have been concentrated efforts by <a href="https://www.michman.org/" target="_blank">MAMA</a> to establish a spaceport in Marquette County, MI.
        </p>
        <h3>
            CONCERNS
        </h3>
        <p>
            Talk about the drawbacks of spaceports. 
            Aside from the potential harmful effects of a normal launch, increased spaceport construction and traffic also prove to be highly disruptive and dangerous to people and the environment. For example, spaceport construction in Boca Chica, Texas, resulted in the displacement of residents of Boca Chica Village and continuously blocks the <a href="http://www.carrizocomecrudonation.com/" target="_blank">Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe</a> from accessing sacred land <a href="#ref">(Azhar, 2022).</a> 
        </p>
        <p>  
            This spaceport site has also been the center of controversy because failed launches pose a serious threat to endangered environments and people <a href="#ref">(Langford, 2023).</a> The people behind these launches claim that these failed launches are just as valuable (link) because they can still collect data from them to better improve their designs. This mentality of "work fast break things" may work in an academic context, but these spaceports involve real communities, real wildlife, and real harm. Read about the joint suit against the FAA concerning a recent failed launch in April <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/02/texas-spacex-lawsuit-faa-environmental-pollution/" target="_blank">here.</a>

        <h3>MAMA</h3>
        <p>
            MAMA (Michigan Aerospace Manufacturers Association) is a lobbyist group that aims to <a href="https://www.michman.org/" target="_blank">"Position Michigan as a viable space state by encouraging public-private partnerships to develop a space ecosystem that will positively affect the standard of living for all residents.‚Äù</a> Based in Sterling Heights, this organization facilitates business development, education, networking opportunities, legislative updates, industry events in the hopes that it can establish Michigan as the next space state.
        </p>
        <p>
            MAMA has three primary initiatives. The one that is relevant for this project is the first: their Michigan Launch Initiative. This initiative is designed to establish horizontal and vertical LEO launch sites and a control center in the state of Michigan. Currently, MAMA is looking to Upper Peninsula to launch <a href="https://citizensforasafeandcleanlakesuperior.org/learn/" target="_blank">by 2026.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Why MI? As one of the most northmost states in the continental US, Michigan is uniquely positioned to create a special and valuable type of orbit: <a href="https://www.esa.int/Education/4._The_polar_orbit" target="_blank">polar orbits.</a>

        <h3>CSCLS</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://citizensforsuperior.org/">Citizens For A Safe & Clean Lake Superior</a> (CSCLS) is a nonprofit organization aiming to protect the Great Lake from environmental harm. CSCLS is specifically concerned with plans to create a vertical launch site in Granot Loma, on the Lake Superior shoreline.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CSCLS is an excellent resource to learn more about this issue and how to help. Here is <a href="https://citizensforsuperior.org/learn/">their explanation</a> of the ongoing situation in the Upper Peninsula.
